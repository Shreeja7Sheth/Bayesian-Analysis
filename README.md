## Survival Times after Mastectomy of Breast Cancer Patients

Description: Survival times in months after mastectomy of women with breast cancer. The cancers are classified as having metastized or not based on a histochemical marker.

The PyMC Bayesian Survival Analysis project demonstrates how to analyze time-to-event data (like survival or failure times) using Bayesian methods. It uses the Weibull distribution to model the likelihood of survival over time, accounting for cases where the event hasn’t happened yet (censoring). The analysis applies Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) to estimate the posterior distributions of model parameters, producing survival functions and hazard rates. The visualizations show survival probabilities with uncertainty intervals.

In the **Bayesian Survival Analysis project** using PyMC, the visualizations play a crucial role in understanding the model output. Here’s a detailed explanation of each type:

### 1. **Survival Function Plot**:
   - **What it shows**: This chart shows the probability that an individual (or item) will survive beyond a certain time. The x-axis represents time, while the y-axis shows the probability of survival.
   - **Uncertainty bands**: Since the analysis is Bayesian, there are credible intervals around the survival curve, reflecting uncertainty in the estimates.
   - **Interpretation**: If the curve stays high, the likelihood of survival is high for longer durations. If it drops quickly, the event (e.g., failure or death) happens sooner.

### 2. **Hazard Function Plot**:
   - **What it shows**: The hazard function illustrates the risk of the event happening at a given time point. It describes the **rate of failure** or event occurrence.
   - **Shape insights**: A rising hazard function indicates increasing risk over time (e.g., an aging product likely to fail), while a constant or decreasing function suggests other risk dynamics.

### 3. **Posterior Distribution Plot**:
   - **What it shows**: This visualization shows the posterior distributions of model parameters, which indicate the likely values for those parameters after incorporating observed data.
   - **Interpretation**: The shape of the posterior distributions allows for uncertainty quantification, showing the range and likelihood of parameter values (e.g., shape and scale of the Weibull distribution).

### 4. **Forest Plot**:
   - **What it shows**: A forest plot typically displays results from multiple studies or sub-models. Each line shows an estimate with its confidence interval.
   - **Interpretation**: This allows comparison between different models or subsets of data, helping to identify trends or consistencies in survival outcomes.

These visualizations provide a comprehensive view of the survival and hazard rates, along with the uncertainty in estimates, which are core to Bayesian analysis.
